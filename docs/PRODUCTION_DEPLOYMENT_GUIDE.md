```bash
# Health check endpoint
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/whatsapp/health

# Worker status  
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/workers/whatsapp

# Analytics endpoint
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/cron/whatsapp-analytics
```

**Functional Testing:**
- Send test messages through WhatsApp
- Verify AI assistant responses
- Test admin interfaces
