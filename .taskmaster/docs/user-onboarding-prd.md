# User Onboarding Flow PRD

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Exponential User Onboarding Flow  
**Priority:** High  
**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks  
**Version:** 1.0  

## Executive Summary

Create a comprehensive user onboarding flow for the Exponential productivity management application that guides new users through account setup, usage preference selection, role specification, tool integration, and first project creation to ensure successful user activation and engagement.

## Problem Statement

Currently, new users who sign up for Exponential may feel overwhelmed by the full feature set without proper guidance on how to get started. This leads to:
- Low user activation rates
- Confusion about which features to use first
- Poor initial user experience
- Higher abandonment rates during first session

## Solution Overview

Implement a guided 4-step onboarding flow that:
1. Determines user intent (work vs personal)
2. Captures role information (if work-related)
3. Enables tool integrations based on user preferences
4. Creates the user's first project to demonstrate core functionality

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories

**US-001:** As a new user, I want to specify whether I'm using Exponential for work or personal purposes so that the application can tailor the experience to my needs.

**US-002:** As a work user, I want to specify my role in the company so that the application can suggest relevant features and workflows.

**US-003:** As a new user, I want to select which tools I currently use so that Exponential can integrate with my existing workflow.

**US-004:** As a new user, I want to create my first project during onboarding so that I can immediately start using the application productively.

**US-005:** As a new user, I want to be guided to the home page after onboarding so that I can begin my regular workflow.

## Technical Requirements

### Database Schema Updates

```sql
-- Add onboarding fields to users table
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN usage_type VARCHAR(20);
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN user_role VARCHAR(100);
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN selected_tools TEXT[]; -- JSON array
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN onboarding_completed_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN onboarding_step INTEGER DEFAULT 1;
```

### API Endpoints

1. **PUT /api/onboarding/usage-type**
   - Updates user's usage type preference
   - Advances onboarding_step to 2 or 3 (based on selection)

2. **PUT /api/onboarding/role**
   - Updates user's role information
   - Advances onboarding_step to 3

3. **PUT /api/onboarding/tools**
   - Updates selected tools array
   - Advances onboarding_step to 4

4. **POST /api/onboarding/first-project**
   - Creates user's first project
   - Marks onboarding as completed
   - Sets onboarding_completed_at timestamp

5. **GET /api/onboarding/status**
   - Returns current onboarding step and completion status

### Frontend Requirements

- **Route:** `/onboarding` (protected route)
- **Framework:** Next.js App Router with TypeScript
- **UI Library:** Mantine v7 components with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management:** React Query for API calls, local state for form data
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Analytics:** Track user interactions and drop-off points

### Authentication & Security

- **Route Protection:** Require valid authentication session
- **Data Validation:** Server-side validation for all form inputs
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevent abuse of onboarding endpoints
- **CSRF Protection:** Standard CSRF tokens for state changes

## Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
- **Onboarding Completion Rate:** % of users who complete all 4 steps
- **Time to First Project:** Average time from sign-up to project creation
- **User Activation Rate:** % of users who create at least one action within 7 days

### Secondary KPIs
- **Step Drop-off Rates:** Track where users abandon the flow
- **Tool Integration Adoption:** % of users who later set up selected tools
- **Feature Discovery:** Usage of features discovered during onboarding

### Target Metrics
- 85% completion rate for onboarding flow
- 60% of users create first action within 24 hours
- 40% reduction in support tickets related to "getting started"

## Implementation Considerations

### Progressive Enhancement
- Core functionality works without JavaScript
- Enhanced experience with interactive elements
- Graceful degradation for older browsers

### Performance
- Lazy load tool logos and non-critical assets
- Minimize bundle size for onboarding pages
- Fast loading times (< 2 seconds on 3G)

### Internationalization
- Design with i18n in mind for future localization
- Use semantic HTML and accessible markup
- Consider RTL languages in layout design

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all form validation logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for complete onboarding flow
- A/B testing framework for optimization

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Features
- **Smart Recommendations:** AI-powered tool and template suggestions
- **Team Onboarding:** Multi-user workspace setup
- **Advanced Integrations:** Real-time tool connections during onboarding
- **Personalized Dashboard:** Custom home page based on onboarding choices

### Analytics & Optimization
- **Heatmap Tracking:** User interaction patterns
- **Conversion Funnel Analysis:** Detailed drop-off analysis
- **User Feedback Collection:** Post-onboarding surveys
- **A/B Testing:** Different onboarding approaches

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Authentication system (NextAuth.js v5)

- Existing project creation functionality
- User profile management system

### External Dependencies
