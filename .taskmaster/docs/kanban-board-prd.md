# Kanban Board System - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive Kanban board system for the productivity management application that allows users to visualize and manage tasks/actions in a board format similar to Linear. The system should integrate seamlessly with the existing project and action management infrastructure.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Kanban Board Interface
- **Visual Board Layout**: Create a horizontal scrolling board with columns representing different task statuses
- **Card-Based Tasks**: Display actions/tasks as draggable cards containing essential information
- **Column Management**: Support for custom columns with predefined statuses (Backlog, Todo, In Progress, In Review, Done, Cancelled)
- **Drag and Drop**: Enable users to move tasks between columns to update status
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure board works on desktop and mobile devices

### 2. Task Status System
- **Status Categories**: 
  - Backlog: Tasks not yet started
  - Todo: Ready to work on
  - In Progress: Currently being worked on
  - In Review: Completed but pending review
  - Done: Completed and approved
  - Cancelled: Discontinued tasks
- **Status Transitions**: Define allowed transitions between statuses
- **Bulk Status Updates**: Allow multiple task status changes
- **Status History**: Track when tasks moved between statuses

### 3. Team Assignment System
- **User Assignment**: Assign tasks to team members from existing user system
- **Multiple Assignees**: Support for multiple people on one task
- **Assignment Filters**: Filter board by assignee
- **Assignment Notifications**: Notify users when assigned to tasks
- **Unassigned Queue**: Dedicated view for unassigned tasks

### 4. Project Integration
- **Project Backlog**: When tasks are moved to projects, they appear in project-specific Kanban boards
- **Cross-Project View**: Global view showing tasks from all projects
- **Project Filtering**: Filter board by specific projects
- **Project-Specific Columns**: Custom columns per project if needed

### 5. Board Views and Toggles
- **All Tasks View**: Global Kanban showing all tasks across projects
- **Project-Specific View**: Board filtered to single project
- **Personal View**: Tasks assigned to current user
- **View Toggle**: Easy switching between different board views
- **Compact/Expanded View**: Different card detail levels

### 6. Task Card Information
- **Card Content**: 
  - Task title and description
  - Project association
  - Assignee avatars
  - Priority indicators
  - Due date if applicable
  - Progress indicators
  - Labels/tags
- **Card Actions**: Quick edit, delete, assign from card
- **Card Details**: Click to open full task details modal

### 7. Board Functionality
- **Real-time Updates**: Live updates when other users make changes
- **Search and Filter**: Find tasks by title, assignee, project, priority
- **Sorting Options**: Sort columns by due date, priority, created date
- **Board Customization**: User preferences for column width, card size
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Navigate and manipulate board with keyboard

### 8. Integration with Existing Systems
- **Action/Task Sync**: Seamless integration with existing Action entity
- **Project Relationship**: Maintain existing project-action relationships
- **Goal/Outcome Integration**: Show related goals and outcomes on cards
- **Daily Planning**: Integration with journal/planning system

## Technical Requirements

### Database Schema Updates
- **Task Status Field**: Update Action model with comprehensive status enum
- **Assignment System**: Create task-user assignment relationship table
- **Board Configuration**: Store user board preferences
- **Status History**: Track status change history

### API Endpoints
- **Board Data**: Efficient endpoints to fetch board data with minimal queries
- **Drag and Drop**: Real-time status updates with optimistic UI updates
- **Bulk Operations**: Endpoints for batch status updates and assignments
- **Real-time Sync**: WebSocket or polling for live updates

### UI Components
- **Kanban Board Component**: Reusable board component with Mantine styling
- **Task Card Component**: Draggable card with consistent design
- **Column Component**: Customizable column headers with counts
- **Assignment Selector**: User assignment interface
- **Status Transition Animation**: Smooth drag and drop feedback

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading**: Load tasks progressively for large boards
- **Virtualization**: Handle boards with hundreds of tasks efficiently
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache board data for fast switching between views
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback with rollback on errors

## User Experience Requirements

### Navigation and Access
- **Board Navigation**: Easy access from main navigation menu
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Clear indication of current view/project
- **Quick Switching**: Fast toggle between list and board views
- **Mobile Experience**: Touch-optimized drag and drop on mobile

### Visual Design
- **Consistent Styling**: Use existing Mantine theme and color system
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between columns, cards, and priorities
- **Loading States**: Appropriate loading indicators for board operations
- **Empty States**: Helpful empty state messages for new boards

### Accessibility
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility for drag and drop
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels for board elements
- **Color Accessibility**: Status indicators that don't rely solely on color
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus handling during drag operations

## Success Criteria

### Functionality
- Users can create and visualize tasks in a Kanban board format
- Tasks can be moved between status columns via drag and drop
- Team members can be assigned to tasks and filtered accordingly
- Project-specific boards integrate seamlessly with existing project system
- All tasks view provides comprehensive overview across projects

### Performance
- Board loads within 2 seconds for up to 500 tasks
- Drag and drop operations feel smooth and responsive
- Real-time updates appear within 1 second
- Mobile performance matches desktop experience

### User Adoption
