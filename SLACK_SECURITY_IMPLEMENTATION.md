# Slack Security Implementation Summary

This document outlines the self-service Slack registration system implemented to address the security vulnerability in the Slack integration.

## üö® Security Issue Addressed

**Problem**: The original Slack webhook handler had an identity substitution vulnerability where unknown Slack users were automatically mapped to integration installers, giving unauthorized users access to the system.

**Solution**: Implemented a self-service registration system that requires explicit authentication and authorization before creating user mappings.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Improvements

### 1. **Database Schema (SlackRegistrationToken)**
- Added `SlackRegistrationToken` model to `schema.prisma:513-533`
- Stores secure registration tokens with:
  - 24-hour expiration
  - Single-use tokens
  - Slack user ID tracking
  - Integration and team association

### 2. **Registration Page**
- **File**: `/src/app/auth/slack-connect/page.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Token validation before showing UI
  - NextAuth.js authentication required
  - Team membership verification
  - Clear user guidance through the process
  - Error handling for expired/invalid tokens

### 3. **tRPC API Endpoints** 
- **File**: `/src/server/api/routers/integration.ts:1205-1438`
- **Endpoints**:
  - `validateSlackRegistrationToken` - Public endpoint for token validation
  - `completeSlackRegistration` - Protected endpoint for completing registration
  - `getUserSlackConnections` - List user's Slack connections  
  - `disconnectSlack` - Remove Slack connections

### 4. **Updated Webhook Security**
- **File**: `/src/app/api/webhooks/slack/route.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Access denied messages now include registration links
  - Automatic registration token generation
  - Fallback to basic message if token creation fails
  - Proper null checking for user IDs

### 5. **Audit Scripts**
- **Files**: 
  - `/scripts/audit-slack-mappings.ts` - Comprehensive audit script
  - `/scripts/cleanup-unauthorized-slack-mappings.ts` - Existing cleanup script (updated for Bun)
- **Features**:
  - Identify suspicious mappings
  - Team membership verification
  - Severity-based reporting
  - Safe deletion capabilities

## üîß How It Works

### Registration Flow:
1. **Unauthorized Slack user** tries to use the bot
2. **System detects** no user mapping exists
3. **Registration token** is created and sent in access denied message
4. **User clicks link** and is taken to `/auth/slack-connect?token=...`
5. **User authenticates** with NextAuth.js
6. **System verifies** user is a team member (if integration has a team)
7. **Mapping is created** linking Slack user ID to authenticated system user
8. **User can now** use the Slack bot with proper authorization

### Access Control:
- **Team integrations**: Only team members can register
- **Personal integrations**: Only the integration owner can register
- **Token security**: 24-hour expiration, single-use, cryptographically secure
- **Audit trail**: All registration attempts logged

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables Required:
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Used for generating registration links
- `DATABASE_URL` - For database operations

### Database Migration:
The `SlackRegistrationToken` table was added to the schema. Run:
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add-slack-registration-tokens
```

### Running Audit Scripts:
```bash
# Analyze existing mappings for security issues
bun scripts/cleanup-unauthorized-slack-mappings.ts

# More comprehensive audit (new script)
bun scripts/audit-slack-mappings.ts
```

## üìã Testing the Implementation

1. **Test unauthorized access**:
   - Have an unmapped Slack user try to use the bot
   - Verify they receive a registration link
   - Check that the link works and requires authentication

2. **Test team membership**:
   - Verify non-team members cannot register for team integrations
   - Verify team members can successfully register

3. **Test token security**:
   - Verify tokens expire after 24 hours
   - Verify tokens can only be used once
   - Verify invalid tokens are rejected

## üîç Log Monitoring

Look for these log messages to monitor the system:
- `üîó [Registration] Created registration link for Slack user`
- `‚úÖ [Slack Registration] User connected Slack`
- `üö® [SECURITY ALERT] Unauthorized Slack access attempt`
- `üîê [Auth] Resolved Slack user to system user`

## üéØ Benefits

1. **Security**: No more automatic user mapping - explicit authorization required
2. **Usability**: Self-service - users don't need admin intervention
3. **Auditability**: Clear trail of who registered and when
4. **Flexibility**: Works for both team and personal integrations
5. **Scalability**: No manual admin work required for new users

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Existing mappings**: The system preserves existing legitimate mappings
- **Backward compatibility**: Authorized users continue to work normally  
- **Fallback**: If registration token creation fails, users still get a basic error message
- **Security**: All tokens are cryptographically secure and expire automatically

The implementation successfully addresses the security vulnerability while maintaining a smooth user experience for legitimate users.
